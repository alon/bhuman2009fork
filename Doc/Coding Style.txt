GermanTeam Coding Style
-----------------------

The best way to understand the coding style is to look at the existing source files. It is also a good idea to copy an existing file and modify it if a new one is required.


The general rules are:

CamelCase anywhere (Java style)
"_" only in preprocessor symbols
All identifiers and all comments use English language

Examples:
MyClass
MyEnum
MyStruct
myMemberVar
myLocalVar
myEnumConstant
MY_PREPROCESSOR_SYMBOL

Only a single statement per line.
"{" and "}" always stand alone in a line
Indention step size is two spaces.
Never use tabulator characters (switch them off in Visual Studio)
Binary and trinary operators are surrounded by spaces: "4 + 5", "x > y ? x : y"
"(", ")", "[", "]" are not surrounded by spaces. Exceptions: in single line functions ("f() {...}") and in the neighborhood of binary operators ("a[0] = ...")
There is no space between if, while, for etc. and the "(", e.g. for(.
Pointers are only used if they cannot be substituted by references.
Objects are always passed by (const) reference
Use "const" as often as possible for
  const member variables
  const member functions
  const parameters
"set" and "get" functions are only implemented where useful.


Before checking in:
- Always get an update before you check in
- Code must be compilable without warnings and errors (including the update)
- Code also used by others must work
- The documentation must be compilable without warnings and errors
- Ensure that you check in all source files required
- Give a meaningful description during check-in
